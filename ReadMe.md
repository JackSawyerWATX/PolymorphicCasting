Polymorphic Casting

UPCASTING - a process of casting subtype to super type – for example from String to Object. Upcasting is casting from a subclass to a superclass. Typically, the upcasting is implicitly performed by the compiler because our subclass is an extension of our superclass.

DOWNCAST – a process of changing the data type from Object to the particular type. Downcasting means the typecasting of a parent object to a child object, which cannot be implicit. This means we manually have to cast objects supertypes to subtypes.

There is a complexity with polymorphic casting, that in order to be well organized, must be mapped out before writinig code and executing.
